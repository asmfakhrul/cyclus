// to call methods like e.g. Tick, Tock, Build, etc.  We already know the
// agents satisfy the Agent class interface implicitly by being able to load
// them and cast/assign them to Agent*/Facility*/etc. without compiler errors.
// From now on, only call state-reporting functions with no side-effects in
// these tests.
